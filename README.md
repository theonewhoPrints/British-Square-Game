This is a MIPS assembly implementation of the "British Square Game" done in my Computer systems class, below is a link if you'd like to know more about the game:
https://boardgameguys.com/british-square/

the files are as follows:

Makefile: the standard file you can use to run and compile the MIPS code.
model.asm: model functionality behind game including game rules, decision making, win/loss conditions and more. 
printing.asm: the user interface and main file that starts the game, provides updates to the user with updated prints.
